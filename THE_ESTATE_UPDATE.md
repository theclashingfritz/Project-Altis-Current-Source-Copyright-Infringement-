# Project Altis: The Estate Update

The Estate Update is an update focused towards upgrading estates.
This kind of update is how I feel formatting post-beta updates will be, not as many, but bigger themed updates.

## What does The Estate Update Offer?
A bunch of estate updates, at this moment, only a couple are done, but much more will come
- Purchasable Interior Layouts - Needs new models though
- A Jukebox at the estate
- A party trampoline
- Much more to come

## Future Plans
- Fisherman at estate
- More estate minigames
- idk probably some more stuff

## Part 1
- Jukebox
- Party Trampoline
- Toonup Cannon Game
