A few days we have Loony Labs open
- you can go inside the main building, it might have some things relating to the behind the scenes of altis, and maybe stuff about the new zap gags

The last day, we will close off the insides of the buildings, and start the announcement event
- announcement about loony labs being renovated or something
- sometime during the announcement, cogs invade, theres time for toons to battle cogs
- A few minutes later, the chairman comes in, walks into the main building
- screen fades black for a few seocnds so it can unload the toon textured model and load the cog textured model - play some sound effects in the background
- screen unfades and u now see the cogish textured playground


techincal workings:

We wont have the playground model loaded in the dna - instead it will be loaded in DistributedBetaEvent - that way we can unload the toon one and replace it with the cog one
